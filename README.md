This is the first approach to create a dockerised proxy server to works as `interface` between frontend and external services.

##Docker

Docker is a technology I wanted to explore and this is a great chance to dive into it. The benefit of using docker is having an isolated setting up of my application, where I can develop and collaborate being sure that dependencies and tools versions are consistent. This means I can have Node:12 installed in my machine but develop this app with Node:14 without having to change the version with `nvm` depending on the projects I work on. This is not just true between collaborators but also ensures that the environment in which the code will be deployed keeps this consistent setting.
